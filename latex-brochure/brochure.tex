\subsection*{\sffamily What they say about \LaTeX}
I was getting increasingly exasperated with the limitations presented
by wordprocessing programs when \LaTeX\ came into my life and
allowed me to do all those things I previously could only dream of,
from unusual symbols to complicated layout. I strongly recommend it
to anybody interested in producing a professional-looking document!
\quoted{Petra Hellmuth, Language Specialist}
\par\medskip
I use pdf\LaTeX\ and \MF\ not only because I need them to create my
presentations, lecture notes and papers but also because it's fun!
Entering a math equation in Powerpoint is a pain in the neck: with
pdf\LaTeX\ and \MP\ it is a lot easier because you can change the
style of what is to be displayed. I have a lecture class from which I
generate a lecture presentation \emph{and} lecture notes all from the
same source: I can add text which appears in one or both of the
documents.

% front RH blurb
\lettrine[lines=3]{I}{f} you need to produce a document for
publication you want robust, professional software which won't let you
down~--- whether it's an annual report, a manual for your customers, a
business plan or white paper for your investors, an article for a
journal, a book for a publisher, a newsletter for your club or
society, or a leaflet or brochure for a product, event, or venue.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item \LaTeX\ is a document preparation system for producing
  high-quality output, based on Don Knuth's revolutionary
  \TeX\ typesetting program. It's been used by millions since its
  launch in 1985, and has been continuously updated to bring you the
  state of the art in accuracy and flexibility.

\item More powerful than a wordprocessor or desktop publishing system,
  \LaTeX\ has a host of unique features which can dramatically cut
  time and cost for any publishing project, especially for long or
  complex documents.

\item Its secret is programmability: hundreds of prewritten templates
  (packages) to handle almost any formatting task~--- or you can
  define your own with the underlying style language. You only have to
  define a pattern once, and all further occurrences then follow that
  style, giving it unrivalled consistency: the key to
  professional-looking output.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Publishing with \LaTeX}

Could your next report, white paper, article, book, paper, review, or
essay benefit from using \LaTeX? Do you need to be able to exchange
documents with colleagues using other types of computer,
without loss of formatting?

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item Default styles give you immediate, automatic draft formatting
  for common types of document.

\item Powerful automation features handle cross-references,
  bibliographic citations, tables of contents, indexes, and glossaries
  with ease.

\item Automated formatting of formulae, designed by one of the world's
  leading computer scientists.

\item Industry-standard Acrobat (\textsc{pdf}) and PostScript
  (\textsc{ps}) output.

\item Available in Open Source and commercial versions.

\item Strongly supported via the Internet, with user groups in many
  countries, and by business-level consultants and vendors.

\item Huge range of fonts and languages supported, with floating and
  fixed accents, hyphenation, and language-based typographic
  rules.

\item Journal and book style files available from leading publishers.

\item Available on almost all platforms: \textsc{pda}s, smartphones,
  and tablets; laptops and desktops; minicomputers, mainframes, and
  supercomputers.

\item Completely portable between systems~--- document files are all
  plain Unicode and can be edited and processed on any supported
  platform.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematics}
Automated mathematical formatting uses a symbolic notation, regardless
of complexity. Spacing and sizing is done to
mathematicians' standards, so this:
\par\medskip
\begingroup\fontsize{7.25}{8}\selectfont
\verb`E(n_{g+1}'|n_i',n_i'';\,1\le i\le g)=(N'-`\linebreak
\verb`N_g')\left[1-\left\{\left(1-\frac{c}`\linebreak
\verb`{cN'+N''}\right)^{n_g'd}\left(1-\frac{c}`\linebreak
\verb`{cN''+N'}\right)^{n_g''d}\right\}\right]`
\par\endgroup\smallskip
results in the equation below. Graphical \LaTeX-based systems
such as \LyX\ and \textit{Scientific Word} have built-in equation
editors for constructing expressions with the mouse and menus.
&
\null\vspace{-2.5em}
\subsection{\sffamily Typefaces}

\noindent Whether you're using Windows or Unix (including Apple Mac
OS\thinspace X and GNU/Linux systems), standard \LaTeX\ works with any
Type~1 outline (PostScript) or Type~3 bitmap (\MF). Using the
\XeLaTeX\ processor (included on the DVD),
you can also use all your TrueType and OpenType fonts. This gives you
access to tens of thousands of typefaces, both free and commercial.

The standard Adobe `35' core PostScript fonts (Times, Palatino,
Century Schoolbook, Helvetica, Zapf Calligraphic. etc) are provided by
default; with the mathematics fonts of Computer Modern,
Euler, Concrete, and Times; and a range of decorative and specialist
typefaces for technical, linguistic, and literary typesetting.

\bigskip\noindent\includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{sample-crop}
\par\bigskip

Non-Latin types include Japanese, Chinese, Devanagari, Urdu, Thai,
Vietnamese, Coptic, Cyrillic, Greek, and many other languages and
alphabets, including mixed bi-directional Arabic and Hebrew. Extensive
user group coverage world-wide provides native-language support for
non-Latin typesetting.

The fontmaking programs \MF\ and \MP\ come with all
\TeX\ systems for designing and implementing your own
typefaces or special symbols.

The calculations of the underlying \TeX\ formatting engine are very
precise: it works internally in microunits smaller than the wavelength
of visible light ($\approx$53.6\AA), resulting in great accuracy in
positioning. \LaTeX\ can use any mixture of Anglo-American, Didot, or
Adobe points, or metric or imperial units.

\subsection{Tables} 

\LaTeX's tables and figures follow the standard publishers' practice
of `floating', so if there is no room on the current page, they
automatically float to the next. Automated crossreferencing means that
tables and figures can be moved around the document and will always
renumber themselves and all their references.

\medskip
There are powerful tabular controls for both simple and complex
designs, with fixed or auto-adjusting spacing which can be very
precisely aligned to provide better visual appeal.  Formal tables and
Figures are automatically numbered, and can be captioned, labelled,
crossreferenced, and included in a List of Tables and List of Figures.

Complex tabular matter can span pages and can be printed landscape
while retaining the portrait orientation of the caption and
pagenumber.  Simple tabular matter can appear anywhere, without being
a formal numbered table.

\subsection{Crossreferences}

The crossreferencing features let you name anything you want to refer
to (table, figure, section, chapter, page, item, etc), and then use
that name anywhere in the document.
This lets each crossreference automatically update its location so
that no matter how much you edit the text, the references remain
correct. The same method is used for automated indexing, glossary,
table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, and bibliographic
references.

The \BibTeX\ bibliographic database lets you store references
separately from documents, and the \BibLaTeX\ system extracts and
automatically formats them to any of the standard styles, including
numeric, in-text, footnotes, or endnotes.

\subsection{Figures and illustrations}

Figures can contain textual or graphical illustrations. Pictures can
be included with scaling, rotation, and clipping, using industry
standard PDF or EPS vector formats for diagrams, or PNG or JPG bitmaps
for pictures.

The book by Lamport is the user manual for \LaTeX: make sure you get
the second edition for \LaTeXe. The \textit{Companion} is more
advanced, but useful if you want to implement your own customised
document designs. Knuth's original \textit{\TeX book} is of interest
mainly to computer scientists and typographic programmers who need to
know the finest detail.

There are dozens of other books, ranging from the online
introductions, \textit{Formatting Information} and \textit{The (not
so) short introduction to \LaTeXe}, to the professional
mathematician's \textit{The Joy of \TeX} and the typographer's
\textit{Digital Typography}.

\subsection{Persistence and reliability}

\LaTeX\ was designed to be independent of any particular manufacturer,
make, or model of computer or printer. Unlike some wordprocessor
manufacturers' proprietary file formats, \LaTeX\ uses plaintext
(\textsc{ascii} or Unicode) files which can be created and updated
with any editor anywhere, and moved between different systems without
danger of information loss or corruption.

The system has been carefully designed so that documents written years
ago can still be typeset. Because the file format is stable, your
investment in intellectual property cannot be damaged by vendors'
arbitrary or planned obsolescence, or by changes in versions or
formats.

\bigskip\hrule\medskip
\sffamily\lite\small\parindent0pt\parskip1em minus.75em
\LaTeX\ material originally produced for paper printing, no matter how
long ago, can quickly and easily be made available for today's Web
access. I have just recently had to provide a journal from 1987--1996
in a format available for the Web.  The opening page was converted
into HTML for quick scanning on the Web, while the complete articles,
with all typesetting and font features (including Hebrew, phonetics,
and Greek), were available for viewing in PDF just by re-running the
\LaTeX\ files.

The biggest advantage in publishing production is that similar
coding of files means anyone can do any journal~--- there is no
need to learn new sets of commands for style variations.
Changes in platforms have no effect on production as \LaTeX\ is
available for all main operating systems.

It is possible to separate the writing tasks (creation of text) from
the design/layout issues (spacing, fonts, etc), which allows the
author simply to identify types of elements (heading levels,
foot/endnotes, citations, etc) without getting bogged down trying to
remember the text shape and font selections for each element.\hfill

\subsubsection*{\sffamily Hardware}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \LaTeX\ will run even on old machines, but a 500MHz processor or
  above is recommended.
\item You should have at least 512Mb of memory, more if you aim to do
  very complex work or use very long documents.
\item You need about 500Mb of hard disk space depending on the options
  you choose (minimal install is about 250Mb; full is about 1.2Gb).
\item The finer your screen and printer resolution, the better quality
  you will be able to see and print. A fast inkjet printer or a laser
  printer is recommended if you need printed output.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{\sffamily Software for editing and reading documents}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item You need a good text editor for creating and maintaining
  documents: there is a selection included on the \TeX\ Collection
  DVD.

\item You also need a PDF reader to view your typeset output (included
  on the \TeX\ Collection DVD), eg
  \textit{GhostScript}/\textit{GSview}, \textit{Okular}, Adobe
  \textit{Acrobat Reader}, etc.

\item You may need a graphics editor (eg \textit{GIMP}) if you want to
  create or modify images (see \textit{Figures}); and a vector editor (eg
  \textit{InkScape}) if you use diagrams.

%\item There is a wide range of other utilities available from the 
%Comprehensive \TeX\ Archive Network.
