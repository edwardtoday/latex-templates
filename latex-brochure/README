                               The LaTeX Brochure

   This is the most recent version (Jan 2013) of the publicity flyer for
   LaTeX that I showed at the TUG meeting in Delaware in 2001. It is
   designed for printing on A3 paper, double-sided, and folding once to
   A4. This version includes a copy for Ledger paper (two Letter pages
   side-by-side).

                         Front and back
                         Front and back Inside pages
                                        Inside pages
